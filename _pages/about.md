I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Architectures Hub (H.IAAC)][7]. I received my PhD in Computer Science at the [Institute of Computing - UNICAMP][1] in September 2023. In 2018, I won a prestigious doctoral scholarship from the [SÃ£o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)][6].

During the doctorate, I spent one year (Research Internships Abroad - FAPESP) as a visiting researcher with the [Networked Systems Modeling][3] research group of Professor [Christoph Sommer][5] in the Faculty of Computer Science at [Technische UniversitÃ¤t Dresden (TU Dresden)][4], Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª, from March 2022 to March 2023.

Before joining UNICAMP, I earned a BS in Information Systems (2015) and an MS in Computer Science (2018), both from the [Federal University of ParÃ¡ (UFPA)][2].

My research interests are:

* Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC)
* Vehicular Clouds
* Task Scheduling & Resource Allocation
* Fault-tolerant Control
* Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X)
