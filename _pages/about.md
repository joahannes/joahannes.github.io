I am an Adjunct Professor at the [Institute of Science and Technology (ICT)](https://www.unifesp.br/campus/sjc/) of the [Federal University of SÃ£o Paulo (UNIFESP)](https://www.unifesp.br/) ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·.
I was Postdoctoral Researcher at the Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Architectures Hub (H.IAAC) from 2023 to 2024. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Institute of Computing (IC) from UNICAMP in September 2023. In 2018, I was awarded a prestigious doctoral scholarship from the [SÃ£o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)][6].

During the doctorate, I spent one year (Research Internships Abroad - FAPESP) as a visiting researcher with the [Networked Systems Modeling][3] research group of Professor [Christoph Sommer][5] in the Faculty of Computer Science at [Technische UniversitÃ¤t Dresden (TU Dresden)][4], Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª, from March 2022 to March 2023.

Before joining UNICAMP, I earned a BS in Information Systems (2015) and an MS in Computer Science (2018), both from the [Federal University of ParÃ¡ (UFPA)][2].

My research interests are:

* Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC)
